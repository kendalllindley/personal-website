    I consistently find myself needing to think through solutions that can be
    scaled. This site is an exercise of breadth. I want to learn what's out
    there and what's possible. It's nice to have you along.

    I've had to wrestle with how to make things scalable for a web team that was
    working for one really big institution. Recently I've had the change to see
    into the world of designing and marketing for hundreds of small businesses.

    ones?!`

    People. I'm socially motivated. I want to make the world a better place.
    Still trying to figure out exactly what I might be capable of.

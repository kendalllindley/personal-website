description: My first go at managing content with Netlify CMS!

Previous to this post I wanted to try to get a content content management system. That was at least the original goal. I was excited to see what a CMS was like that focused on content, decoupled from a front end.

Like many things in life, I made it far too complicated. I assumed I should start with Netlify CMS, a domain that I had just purchased from GoDaddy, and jump straight into editing the auto generated site locally on my Windows 10 machine in Windows Subsystem for linux using Vim -an editor I only know well enough to open, instert and ":wq" as carefully as possible. It was too many variables, so here I am, backtracking to step 1: see what managing content is like in a decoupled CMS, withough a custom domain, personalized site, or a working development environment. *Swoosh*

The goal: experiment with a _content focused_ content management system. That was at least the original goal. I was excited to see what a CMS was like when decoupled from a front end.

I rightly thought I'd start with Netlify CMS and a domain that I had just purchased from GoDaddy. Simple enough. But then I decided I needed to edit the auto-generated site locally on my Windows 10 machine... in Windows Subsystem for Linux (maybe with Vim!). Reach for the stars, right? Wrong. There were too many variables. It was hard enough just getting back out of the command line text editor.

So, here I am, backtracking to step 1: see what managing content is like in a decoupled CMS, **without** a custom domain, personalized site, or a working development environment. _Swoosh._

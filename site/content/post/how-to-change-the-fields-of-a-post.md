I;m going to try to learn how to edit the fields in the netlify CMS - if it's even possible - to add the fields necessary for a calendar event system. I will be adding my findings to this post as I learn!

I started digging into the github repo and found this file, /blob/master/site/static/admin/config.yml. It looks very promising.

I need to line up the "Label", "Name" and "widget" values with fields in the CMS before I'll have confidence to make changes.
